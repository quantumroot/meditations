Faisal Ahmed Shuvo, born on January 29, 1995. He grew up in Dhaka with his mother, father, and four siblings. He completed his schooling and college from Dhaka Residential Model College and graduated in Computer Science and Engineering from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology.

Even though his formal education was in science and engineering, Faisal's primary interest and area of self-study is philosophy and comparative religious studies. Without any formal education in philosophy, he has immersed himself in studying everything from ancient Chinese, Greek, and Roman philosophies to modern Eastern and Western philosophical schools of thought. He has scholarly discussions on Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Christianity. Alongside his studies, he volunteers at various social service institutions, strives to walk the path of justice and truth, and remains engaged in political activism advocating for fairness and equity. He has been politically active since his university days, participating in various movements for justice.

He had a knack for writing from a young age. He regularly wrote for the magazines of his educational institutions. At one point, he also wrote for newspapers. 'Suhassini' is his first poetic work. Currently, he is working on a theo-philosophical novel.

In addition to all of these, he enjoys weightlifting, cooking, yoga, trekking in the mountains and by the sea, and practicing boxing. Occasionally, in his spare time, he delves into applying computer science theories to engineer solutions for real-world problems.
