Since our beginnings as Homo sapiens, staring up at a star-studded sky, fear has been embedded in our core. It's a primal emotion, born from our fear of death, loneliness, and pain.

In the depth of those nights, the shadows held threats â€“ hunger, biting cold, treachery, and conflict. These elements amplified our fear. A soul confronted with such darkness might retreat from vital activities like hunting or farming. Even if they engaged, it was with trepidation.

Conversely, from our earliest days, witnessing the first light of dawn, laughter found its place in our hearts. It's as age-old as the emotion of fear. We found laughter in jokes, tales, art, and cherished memories.

With the morning came blessings. The sunrise itself was a gift, bringing with it hope, warmth, creativity, and joy. These factors kindled our laughter and hope. A heart filled with joy, upon encountering these elements of dawn, would resonate with even more laughter.

In between the spectrum of fear and laughter, there was listening. Through listening, one could hear tales of fear and transform them into stories of hope and laughter. By lending an ear to the fears of another, the comfort of shared laughter emerged, bridging the gap between the darkest nights and the brightest mornings.
